# Here we can specify which ports we want publicly accessible. Currently by default
# any connection to your service is password protected.

# For example, if we run a React app, we may want to make 3000 open
# to communicate with our backend, or to share a public link of our project.

# USE CASES:
# Testing (sending requests through Postman)
# Frontend - backend connection (sending and receiving requests)
# Production deploys (post a public url of your website)
